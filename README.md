# andromadabrowser

Andromada Browser is a highly extensible cross-platform web browser designed to act as an alterantive to Chroium based browsers and Fireox based browsers. Developed from the ground up using Webkit and Rust Andromada Browser is designed to be easily customizable by the user either through the browser itself or an easily accessable configuration file. I have never worked with Rust or Webkit in the past so this project will act as a proving ground for my technical knowledge not only application side but also server side.
