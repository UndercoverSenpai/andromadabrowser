Cross platform privacy oriented browser based on Webkit

Andromada Browser is an privacy oriented Webkit based browser designed to act as an alternative to Gecko-based browsers and Chromium-based browsers. Desinged to be cross platform, Andromada allows users to fully customize their browser based on their needs and desires. By default the browser allows users to import browsing data, bookmarks, etc. from Chromium and Gecko bassed browsers. Tabs are oriented in a vertical format by default but chan be chaged to a horizontal orientation without accessing the configuruation file. Andromada Browser is avalible on Windows, MacOS, and all major Linux/BSD distributions along with applications for iOS and Android. Designed with privacy and security in mind Andromada ships with Ublock Origin enabled by default (Firefox extension) along with privacy preserving extensions such as  Decentraleyes (more extensions to be added at a later date). To offer an alterantive to the TOR browser and Brave Browser Andromada offers routing over the TOR network (accessable through a hamburger menu present in the search bar) so users can access .onion links without leaving the browser. 

Andromada Browser development and operations are funded solely by donations. The Andromada Team under no circumstance will allow user data to be modified or sold for the purpose of generating revenue.
